This repository provides the analysis code for single cell measurements on AFM and all the original data we used in the paper.

For reproduction:

Figure 1 :the self-written code for shape analysis could be found on the link:https://github.com/steffengrosser/smart-3D-registration-2019 and https://github.com/JuergenLippoldt/On-Motility-and-Form

Figure 2-4: you could find all the data you need to recreate the figure in the folder "all data"(you could open the .ogw file with Origin). In addition, we also include the matlab code for analysing the .tsv file from AFM and applying the fractional model. You could find the code in the folder "AFM code".
